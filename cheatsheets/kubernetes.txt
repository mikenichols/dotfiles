In order to use k8s, your app needs to run inside a Container.
A few implementations of containers are docker, containerd, and CRI-O.
A set of Containers is called a Pod.
Many Pods are run on a Node, which is a worker machine.
Within a Node:
- kubelet, sort of like a supervisor
- kube-proxy which handles networking
- container runtime

The Control Plane manages one or more Nodes.
This Control Plane along with Node(s) is called a Cluster.
Clusters contain (by default) a DNS addon for resolving addresses of Nodes within a Cluster.

The Control Plane contains many components.
kube-apiserver is the front-end for the Control Plane, it scales horizontally.
etcd is a key/value store for all Cluster data.
kube-scheduler assigns Pods to Nodes.
kube-controller-manager is a collection of controllers (in a single binary) that are
  responsible for transforming the current state of the Cluster into the desired state.
cloud-controller-manager handles cloud-specific control logic. For example, if you
  need to scale up with more servers, CCM tells your cloud provider to spin up more servers.
